# My Deep Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository of deep learning projects! This space serves as a portfolio of my work and a log of my progress in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Each project here represents a new concept learned and a new problem solved.

## üöÄ Projects

Here is a summary of the projects completed so far. As I continue to learn, this list will grow.

| # | Project Name | Description | Key Concepts Learned |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)** | A foundational "Hello, World!" project for image classification. This notebook builds a simple feed-forward neural network to recognize handwritten digits from 0 to 9 with ~98% accuracy. | `TensorFlow/Keras`, `Sequential Model`, `Dense Layers`, `Data Preprocessing & Normalization`, `Model Training & Evaluation` |
|   | *(Your next project will go here!)* | | |


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

* **Primary Framework:** TensorFlow & Keras
* **Core Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib
* **Development Environment:** Kaggle Notebooks
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Usage

Each project is contained within its own Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file). To explore a project, you can clone this repository and run the notebook in an environment like Kaggle, Google Colab, or a local setup with the required libraries installed.
