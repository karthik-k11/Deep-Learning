# My Deep Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository of deep learning projects! This space serves as a portfolio of my work and a log of my progress in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Each project here represents a new concept learned and a new problem solved.

## 🚀 Projects

Here is a summary of the projects completed so far. As I continue to learn, this list will grow.

| # | Project Name | Description | Key Concepts Learned |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)** | A foundational "Hello, World!" project for image classification. This notebook builds a simple feed-forward neural network to recognize handwritten digits from 0 to 9 with ~98% accuracy. | `TensorFlow/Keras`, `Sequential Model`, `Dense Layers`, `Data Preprocessing & Normalization`, `Model Training & Evaluation` |
| 2 | **IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis** | An introductory NLP project performing binary classification on movie reviews. The model uses word embeddings and dense layers with **Dropout** regularization to fix overfitting, achieving ~87.8% accuracy. | `NLP & Word Embeddings`, `Sequence Padding`, `Binary Classification`, `Dropout Regularization`, `GlobalAveragePooling1D`, `Overfitting Analysis` |
